The goal of this project is to provide a set of bindings to allow the formidable [Ext 2.0](http://extjs.com/) component set to be used under the equally formidable [Echo3](http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo3) client/server framework.

## Status ##

A lot is working, and the software is now being used in anger in a major application.  You can see which components are implemented on the component status page (link on the right).

## Demo ##
Check out the source, and type 'ant war' on the command line.

The demo is not well organised, but does show most of the features.

## News / Discussion group ##
